After extracting the downloaded 7z file contents just place the entire folder
"Improved Turrets PLUS" into your Mods folder and you should be ready to go. 
Installs just like almost every mod. Does not require a new game.

This mod improves the existing turrets and adds 2 new ones. The power, range 
and accuracy have been increased and ammo consumption is greatly reduced.
The 2 new ones use .44 Magnum and 7.62 ammo. The .44 is stronger than the 9mm 
and the 7.62 is the most powerful. The range of the 9mm is increased from the 
stock 30 meters to 40 meters, the .44 will reach to 60 meters and the 7.62 will
reach 80 meters. The stock Entity Damage setting for the 9mm is changed from 32
to 40, the .44 is set at 45 and the 7.62 is set at 50. The Shotgun Turret range
has been increased from 15 meters to 30 meters and the "spread" of the shot has
been reduced.

While the damage to entities (zombies) has been increased, the damage to blocks
such as terrain or buildings has been reduced. Saves wear and tear on your area! 

These turrets will cover a lot greater area than the "vanilla" ones... instead
of a 90 degree coverage you will now have well over 180 degrees of coverage.
The camera view will not reflect this change but you will see it in action. Just
point the camera in the general direction you want to cover.

This mod will allow you turrets much sooner than previously. You no longer need
a schematic for them and the Gunslinger Perk will enable them instead of the 
Advanced Engineering Perk. Recipes for these turrets have been changed and now 
use ingredients that are more readily available. They will need to be crafted
on a workbench. Again, no schematics are needed!

The firing sounds have been changed. The 9mm uses firing sound from the M60, the
.44 uses firing sound from the Desert Vulture and the 7.62 uses the firing sound
from the .44 Magnum. If you have a variety of turrets set up you will be able to
tell them apart by the sound.  A note for headset users... the 7.62 turret 
is very LOUD! Be prepared! 

Also, this mod will make the solar panels tougher and more resistant to damage.

I hope you enjoy the new turrets as much as I have!
